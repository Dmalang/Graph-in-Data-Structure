# Graph-in-Data-Structure

# Introduction

The "City Network Navigator" is a Java console application that uses a graph structure to model and navigate a city's road network. It enables users to add cities as nodes, connect them with roads as edges, and find the shortest path between two cities using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

# What It Can Do :

-  Add cities (nodes) to the network.
-  Connect cities with roads (edges) and assign weights representing travel distances     	or costs.
-  Display all cities and their direct connections.
-  Compute the shortest path between two specified cities.

# Why I Made This Application and How does it contribute to me and to the community :

The idea for this application was inspired by my studies in Information Technology and my fascination with practical applications of data structures like graphs. It contributes to my learning by helping me understand graph traversal algorithms and how they can solve real-world problems.

For the community, this kind of application can be a starting point for more advanced systems, such as GPS navigation software or transportation network planning tools, offering foundational concepts for developing solutions for logistics, travel, and urban planning.
